# R(ust)PG2D roadmap

Planned features of R(ust)PG2D, grouped into themed releases, with the design decisions and the
code hook points already worked out so that a session can start an item without re-exploring the
codebase. What is shipped is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); the rules for branches, versions
and releases are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); coding and verification rules in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

Status marks: `[ ]` open · `[~] feature/<branch>` in progress · `[x]` done, waiting for the release.
Shipped versions are not listed here: CHANGELOG.md is their record.

## How to work from this roadmap

Instructions for every session (people and coding agents) that implements roadmap items:

1. **Pick the item.** Unless the user names one, take the first open item of the lowest
   unreleased version, in the order listed (later items build on earlier ones). Read its whole
   block: *Goal*, *Design* (defaults are decided; keep them unless the user says otherwise),
   *Engine* (none, or the agreed engine addition), *Touch points*, *Example*, *Verify*. Line numbers are not given on purpose: find the named
   functions and structs with grep, they move.
2. **Content or engine?** Plan the item as content first (CLAUDE.md, *Content route*): events,
   scripts, definitions, structures and assets in the starter library and the example project.
   When an engine addition is unavoidable, propose the smallest generic one to the user and wait
   for the go-ahead before changing Rust code. Record the outcome in the item's *Engine* line:
   "none (content)" or the agreed addition and why.
3. **Branch.** `git checkout master && git pull --ff-only && git checkout -b feature/<item-slug>`
   (the slug is given in the item's heading). One item per branch; a release's items are
   separate pull requests into `master`.
4. **Mark it.** Change the item's mark to `[~] feature/<slug>` in the first commit of the branch
   and to `[x]` (version left empty until the release) in the last one. Keep the *Design* block
   true: if the implementation deviates, edit the block so the roadmap matches the code.
5. **Compatibility is a hard rule** (see CLAUDE.md): new `Action`, `Cond`, `TriggerOn`,
   `ZoneKind`, `OnUnlock` variants are appended; new fields get `#[serde(default)]`; new map
   object fields go into the RON `Meta` of `map/io.rs`; save games (`WorldState`) and
   definitions of every released version must still load. Add a test that parses an old RON
   without the new fields when you add fields to `WorldState` or a definition.
6. **A feature is done when** it works in the running binaries, its assets are in the starter
   library (and the example project when it shows it), is covered by the scripted checks in
   *Verify* (autoplay / editor script + screenshots, on a scratch copy of the example project),
   has tests where engine logic changed, is documented
   (the manual in `Documentation/manual/`, its `08-scripting.md` for every script function,
   the editor's `API` table, CHANGELOG *Unreleased*), and `cargo build / clippy -D warnings / test --workspace`
   pass. The example project (`example_project/`, edited with the editor or its AI agent
   server) shows the feature: add new entities instead of recreating existing ones, so uids
   stay stable.
7. **Commit, push and open pull requests only when the user asks.** When all items of a
   version are `[x]` (or the user decides to ship early), cut `release/X.Y.Z` as described in
   AGENTS.md and remove the version's section from this file (its design notes live on in the
   CHANGELOG and the code).
8. **Changing the roadmap** is fine: reorder, move items between versions, split or merge
   them, add new ideas to *Backlog*. Keep every item's block in the same shape. Don't delete
   design notes of open items; replace them.
9. **Record what you decided.** When the implementation deviates from the *Design* block, add
   a *Decided while building* paragraph to the item (before *Touch points*) instead of
   rewriting the design; later items and the release notes rely on it. The *Verify* block
   lists what was actually checked; say in the report what was compile-checked only (e.g.
   editor fields below the visible area, which the editor script cannot scroll to).
10. **Scripted checks that hold up.** Park the autoplay mouse before navigating menus
   (`drag 2 2 2 2` as the first command), or the real pointer over the test window changes
   the selection. Start from a crafted `saves/quick.ron` (`press f9`) to skip arrival
   cut-scenes; a pending dialog blocks autosaves and queued actions (`press e` twice). Add a
   `status()` field for every new state (`attacking=`, `shake=`, `pad=`, …) rather than
   reading screenshots for it; use screenshots for looks. Never delete with a relative path
   after `cd`; use a fresh scratch folder instead.
11. **Dependencies and packages.** A new crate that links a system library (gilrs → libudev)
    means: the CI apt lines (`ci.yml`, `release.yml`), the README's build prerequisites, a
    check that the release game still needs glibc ≤ 2.34 (`objdump -T target/release/
    rustpg2d-game | grep GLIBC_`), the Debian 12 container (`ldd`), and the Flatpak permissions
    (`--device`, `--socket`) in `editor/src/package.rs` and `xtask/src/dist.rs`.
12. **Example content.** `example_project/` and the starter library
    (`crates/editor/assets/starter_library/`) are plain files: edit them with the editor or its AI
    agent server (CLAUDE.md, *Example content*), send new or changed example assets to the
    starter library (`library_send` with `replace`, plus `drop_script_triggers` for assets whose
    triggers run the example's story scripts; the library set to that folder) and commit both together; existing entities keep their uids; give new example
    characters their own ids; never touch `example_project/saves/`.
13. **Branches that touch the same files.** Start the second item's branch from the first one
    (as *Save thumbnails* did from *Screen shake*, both in `menu.rs`), open the pull requests
    in that order, and say so in the pull request text. One pull request per item.
14. **Documentation per item**, all before the report: the manual chapter of the area
    (`Documentation/manual/`; controls in `15-players-guide.md`, events in `07-events.md`),
    a README highlight for notable features, `08-scripting.md` for every script function (a test
    fails otherwise), the editor's `API` table, CHANGELOG under the matching `###` heading of
    *Unreleased* (Gameplay, Editor, Fixes, Documentation, Maintenance), the roadmap mark.
15. **CI hiccups.** A job that fails within a minute with a download timeout
    (`static.rust-lang.org`) is the runner's network: `gh run rerun <id> --failed`.
16. **Cutting a release.** `release/X.Y.Z` from master: version in `Cargo.toml` (the build
    updates `Cargo.lock`), `## Unreleased` → `## X.Y.Z — date`, README *Current version*,
    the version's roadmap section removed from this file (the CHANGELOG is its record),
    `starter_history.ron` current (`cargo run -p rustpg2d-editor --example starter_history`; the
    tests fail otherwise), `cargo xtask check-version release/X.Y.Z`, pull request into master, merge after the
    checks: the Release workflow tags and publishes it.

## Backlog (unscheduled ideas)

- Code signing and notarization of the Windows and macOS games (today: Windows unsigned, macOS
  ad-hoc signed; documented). Packaging work: needs the user's go-ahead.
- Eight facings for characters: 3D models can be drawn turned to any angle, so diagonal walking
  could show diagonal facings (`entity::Facing` has four; the pose cache key, `facing_yaw`,
  movement and the editor's facing pickers would need the four diagonals, saves keep loading).
- A memory budget for the pose atlas: rendered poses live in 1024 px atlas pages that are
  reused by age (`render/model.rs`, `alloc`); a cap in MB and a status line of pages in use would
  keep big casts on small GPUs in check.
- The game's icon from the player's 3D model: `icon.rs` draws `hero_icon` from the project's
  player portrait; without one, a bust render of the player's model (`Models::pose` with `bust`)
  could be the window and package icon.
