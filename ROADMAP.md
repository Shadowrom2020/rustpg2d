# R(ust)PG2D roadmap

Planned features of R(ust)PG2D, grouped into themed releases, with the design decisions and the
code hook points already worked out so that a session can start an item without re-exploring the
codebase. What is shipped is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); the rules for branches, versions
and releases are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); coding and verification rules in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

Status marks: `[ ]` open · `[~] feature/<branch>` in progress · `[x] X.Y.Z` shipped.

## How to work from this roadmap

Instructions for every session (people and coding agents) that implements roadmap items:

1. **Pick the item.** Unless the user names one, take the first open item of the lowest
   unreleased version, in the order listed (later items build on earlier ones). Read its whole
   block: *Goal*, *Design* (defaults are decided; keep them unless the user says otherwise),
   *Touch points*, *Example*, *Verify*. Line numbers are not given on purpose: find the named
   functions and structs with grep, they move.
2. **Branch.** `git checkout develop && git pull --ff-only && git checkout -b feature/<item-slug>`
   (the slug is given in the item's heading). One item per branch; a release's items are
   separate pull requests into `develop`.
3. **Mark it.** Change the item's mark to `[~] feature/<slug>` in the first commit of the branch
   and to `[x]` (version left empty until the release) in the last one. Keep the *Design* block
   true: if the implementation deviates, edit the block so the roadmap matches the code.
4. **Compatibility is a hard rule** (see CLAUDE.md): new `Action`, `Cond`, `TriggerOn`,
   `ZoneKind`, `OnUnlock` variants are appended; new fields get `#[serde(default)]`; new map
   object fields go into the RON `Meta` of `map/io.rs`; save games (`WorldState`) and
   definitions of every released version must still load. Add a test that parses an old RON
   without the new fields when you add fields to `WorldState` or a definition.
5. **A feature is done when** it works in the running binaries, is covered by the
   scripted checks in *Verify* (autoplay / editor script + screenshots, on a scratch copy of
   the example project), has tests where the engine logic allows, is documented
   (`README.md`, `Documentation/scripting.md` for every script function, the editor's `API`
   table, CHANGELOG *Unreleased*), and `cargo build / clippy -D warnings / test --workspace`
   pass. The example project (`crates/engine/examples/gen_example/`) shows the feature: add
   new entities at the end of a map function so uids stay stable, then regenerate.
6. **Commit, push and open pull requests only when the user asks.** When all items of a
   version are `[x]` (or the user decides to ship early), cut `release/X.Y.Z` as described in
   AGENTS.md, fill in the version in the marks, and move the version's section to *Shipped*
   at the end of this file (one line per item).
7. **Changing the roadmap** is fine: reorder, move items between versions, split or merge
   them, add new ideas to *Backlog*. Keep every item's block in the same shape. Don't delete
   design notes of open items; replace them.
8. **Record what you decided.** When the implementation deviates from the *Design* block, add
   a *Decided while building* paragraph to the item (before *Touch points*) instead of
   rewriting the design; later items and the release notes rely on it. The *Verify* block
   lists what was actually checked; say in the report what was compile-checked only (e.g.
   editor fields below the visible area, which the editor script cannot scroll to).
9. **Scripted checks that hold up.** Park the autoplay mouse before navigating menus
   (`drag 2 2 2 2` as the first command), or the real pointer over the test window changes
   the selection. Start from a crafted `saves/quick.ron` (`press f9`) to skip arrival
   cut-scenes; a pending dialog blocks autosaves and queued actions (`press e` twice). Add a
   `status()` field for every new state (`attacking=`, `shake=`, `pad=`, …) rather than
   reading screenshots for it; use screenshots for looks. Never delete with a relative path
   after `cd`; use a fresh scratch folder instead.
10. **Dependencies and packages.** A new crate that links a system library (gilrs → libudev)
    means: the CI apt lines (`ci.yml`, `release.yml`), the README's build prerequisites, a
    check that the release game still needs glibc ≤ 2.34 (`objdump -T target/release/
    rustpg2d-game | grep GLIBC_`), the Debian 12 container (`ldd`), and the Flatpak permissions
    (`--device`, `--socket`) in `editor/src/package.rs` and `xtask/src/dist.rs`.
11. **Example content.** Regenerate with `cargo run -p rustpg2d-engine --example gen_example`
    and commit `example_project/` and `crates/editor/assets/starter.r2dpack` together; new
    entities go at the end of a map function; an example id overrides the starter library's
    (give new example characters their own ids); never touch `example_project/saves/`.
12. **Branches that touch the same files.** Start the second item's branch from the first one
    (as *Save thumbnails* did from *Screen shake*, both in `menu.rs`), open the pull requests
    in that order, and say so in the pull request text. One pull request per item.
13. **Documentation per item**, all before the report: README (feature bullet; controls, events
    and scripting summaries), `Documentation/scripting.md` for every script function (a test
    fails otherwise), the editor's `API` table, CHANGELOG under the matching `###` heading of
    *Unreleased* (Gameplay, Editor, Fixes, Maintenance), the roadmap mark.
14. **CI hiccups.** A job that fails within a minute with a download timeout
    (`static.rust-lang.org`) is the runner's network: `gh run rerun <id> --failed`.
15. **Cutting a release.** `release/X.Y.Z` from develop: version in `Cargo.toml` (the build
    updates `Cargo.lock`), `## Unreleased` → `## X.Y.Z — date`, README *Current version*,
    the version's roadmap section replaced by one line per item under *Shipped* (its design
    notes live on in the CHANGELOG and the code), `cargo xtask check-version release/X.Y.Z`,
    pull request into master, merge after the four checks, merge the back-merge pull request.

## 0.10.0 — Agents

Theme: AI agents help creators build content and adventures from inside the editor.

### [~] AI agent server (MCP) — `feature/mcp-server`

**Goal.** The running editor serves the Model Context Protocol, so agents (Claude Code, Cursor,
Claude Desktop, …) read everything, build maps and definitions, write dialogs, quests, scripts
and translations, and play-test with screenshots — with their edits visible and undoable in the
editor at once.

**Design.** In-process server over Streamable HTTP on `127.0.0.1:7743/mcp` (`rmcp` 3 on an axum
listener, its own tokio thread; `crates/editor/src/mcp/`). Every tool call travels to the main
thread as an `AgentRequest` and runs between frames against the `Editor` (`mcp_drain`, ≤ 40
calls / 8 ms per frame): map edits through `MapDoc` (strokes, `record_objects` with per-tool
tags → one undo step each), definitions through `project.db`, then `save_all`, `refresh_refs`
and the project check's warnings (`mcp_after_write`). Long work finishes on the agent thread
(`play_test` runs the game with `tokio::process`); screenshots are grabbed after the next drawn
frame (`mcp_capture_shots`). Coordinates are tiles, JSON is serde's form of the engine types,
replies are bounded (80x50 grids, 200-row pages, 48 k chars, 6 images). The watcher
(`watcher.rs`) polls `project.ron`, `defs/`, `maps/`, `scripts/`, `lang/` every second and
reloads clean documents, a banner asks for dirty ones; the editor's saves re-snapshot.
Resources serve `Documentation/{mcp,scripting,events,autoplay}.md`; prompts `design_quest`,
`build_map`. Settings in `<config>/editor.ron`; window under *Assets*; status-bar indicator.

**Decided while building.** `rmcp` 3.9's `#[tool_router]` / `#[tool_handler]` with doc comments
as descriptions and `Parameters<T>` (schemars) for schemas; stop = drop the listener and
`shutdown_timeout`, so the port frees at once even with SSE streams open. `write_translation`
builds the template first so new script texts become keys. `Interact` is a legal zone event.

**Touch points.** `editor/src/mcp/{mod,server,tools,exec,exec_maps,exec_defs,grid,patch,play,
watcher,ui}.rs`, `editor/src/{main,app,files,maps,database}.rs`, `engine/src/{project,refactor}.rs`,
`editor/Cargo.toml`, `Documentation/{mcp,events,autoplay}.md`, README, CLAUDE.md.

**Verify.** Unit tests: grids / legends / `paint_grid` round trip, merge patches and entity
tiles, autoplay rewriting, docs completeness (every tool in `mcp.md`, every autoplay command in
`autoplay.md`). Live: the editor with `mcp on 7743` driven by a Python MCP client over Streamable
HTTP — all 51 tools exercised on a scratch copy of the example (reads, every write with
`get_map` read-back, undo / redo / save, `play_test` with a screenshot, `screenshot_map` /
`screenshot_editor`, validation errors with suggestions); the watcher reloading touched
definitions and the open map; the window and status bar in screenshots.

## Backlog (unscheduled ideas)

- Code signing and notarization of the Windows and macOS games (today: Windows unsigned, macOS
  ad-hoc signed; documented).
- Gamepad button glyphs in the HUD and hints (Steam Deck); rebinding gamepad buttons.
- Companions learn spells from scrolls and books given to them and cast heal / bolt spells by
  the rules of *Companion inventory* (`Companion.spells`, a mana pool from the definition).
- Activities that produce something: the fishing NPC sells fresh trout at a market stall the
  next morning (a trigger at the end of an *NPC routines* activity).
- **Swimming and ladders** (moved out of 0.5.0 and 0.8.0; design notes kept, branch
  `feature/swim-climb`): water the player can swim across and ladder tiles to climb.
  **Goal.** Water the player can swim across (slowly, no attacks) and ladder tiles the player
  climbs (vertical only, slower, climbing pose), so maps gain height and water as terrain
  instead of walls.

  **Design.**
  - `TilesetDef.water: Vec<u32>` and `TilesetDef.ladder: Vec<u32>` (`#[serde(default)]`, like
    `solid`); the Tilesets form's grid gets two more pick modes (today: solid, animation, light).
    `Loaded` gets `water` / `ladder` grids next to `solid` (`Assets::compute_solid` pattern). A
    water tile marked swimmable is **not** solid for the player only: `rect_blocked(.., swimmer:
    bool)`; NPCs, pathfinding, projectiles and sight keep treating it as today (solid if listed in
    `solid`). Creators mark a tile either solid (a wall of water) or water (swimmable).
  - Swimming: when the player's feet are on water: speed × 0.5, no running, no attacking (toast
    once), no interacting with props, no fishing, no sitting; the paperdoll is drawn with the
    lower 40 % of the frame clipped (`draw_frame_part_in`, as the seated pose clips) and a 2 px
    bob, a blue tint; a splash `effect` on entering; `status()` `swimming=true`. Leaving water
    restores everything. Companions swim along (same rule for them).
  - Ladders: on a ladder tile only Up / Down move (× 0.6 speed), the player faces Up (climbing
    pose = the Up row with the walk cycle), interact is allowed (so a ladder top can be a portal
    zone, which is how "climbing down into the mine" works). `status()` `climbing=true`.
  - Save games don't change (position is enough). Old projects: no water / ladder tiles → nothing
    changes.

  **Touch points.** `defs.rs`, `render/mod.rs` (`TilesetTex` flags), `runtime/{mod,paperdoll,
  companions,minigame,furniture}.rs`, `editor/src/database.rs` (tileset grid modes) and
  `canvas.rs` (overlay colours), gen_example (mark the village pond and the Wilds' lakes
  swimmable, keep the forest stream solid; a ladder tile in the dungeon tileset and a ladder in
  the mine leading to a lower shaft via portals), README.

  **Example.** The village pond becomes swimmable (its fishing spot covers the water: fishing is
  from the shore, not while swimming); the mine gets a ladder down to a small lower shaft with the
  pick-only chest moved there.

  **Verify.** Autoplay: walk into the pond, `status` `swimming=true` and the tile is water, speed
  halved (tiles per second from two statuses), `press x` doesn't attack, screenshot of the
  half-submerged hero; the forest stream still blocks; in the mine `hold up` on the ladder
  climbs (`climbing=true`), `hold left` doesn't move; an NPC never enters water (`ai=` positions).
